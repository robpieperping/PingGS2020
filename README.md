# Ping Identity DevOps
This repository provides foundational examples to try different configurations and deployments of the Ping Identity solutions using the DevOps images and toolkit. 

## Documentation

### ldapsdk tool
Use the `ldapsdk` tool in the top level directory to startup an `ldap-sdk-tools` container
allowing for easy access to the LDAP SDK Tools (such as ldapsearch, ldapmodify, and other tools).

Running `ldapsdk` the first time will help configure your settings.  After that, you
simply run.  To edit the settings in the future, use the configure option:
`ldapsdk configure`.

### Bash profile Docker helper aliases
Several aliases are available in the utility `bash_profile_devops` to perform common 
Docker commands with containers, images, services, and so on.  You can easily source this
from your bash startup file (i.e. .bash_profile) to make easy use of these alias.

### Docker images

* A complete listing of the Ping Identity solutions public images used in these examples is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pingidentity/).
