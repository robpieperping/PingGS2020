# GitHub Private Repos

Most often you will not want to expose your Server Profiles publically but rather persist your product configuration in private GitHub repositories. In this document, we'll cover how to generate GitHub access tokens and how to update your YAML files to access private repos.

## Create an Access Token

### In GitHub

* Navigate to '**Settings**' -> '**Developer Settings**' -> '**Personal access tokens**'
* From `Personal access tokens' click the button to '**Generate new token**'
* Given the token a name
* Grant the token priviledge to the **repo** group

* Scroll to the bottom and click '**Generate Token**'

```Note: Copy the token to a secure location as you will not be able to view the token again.```


## Using the token in YAML

To use the token within your YAML file, update the Server Profile to use the following format

* https://GIT_HUB_USERNAME:GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/PATH_TO_REPO.git

### Example URL

* SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github_user:zqb4famrbadjv39jdi6shvl1xvozut7tamd5v6eva@github.com/pingidentity/server_profile.git
